## Internship Practice

Welcome to my daily internship practice log! This repository serves as a dedicated space to document my learning journey, technical growth, and the daily tasks I tackle during my internship.

## Purpose
The goal of this repo is to maintain a consistent coding streak and provide a searchable history of the concepts, bugs, and features I work on every day.
